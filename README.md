Welcome to the repository of my personal portfolio and blog! This monorepo üì¶ contains all the components necessary to run my website which showcases my projects üöÄ, blogs ‚úçÔ∏è, and professional details üìÑ.

## üìå Introduction

This project is my professional and personal showcase. It's where you can find my work portfolio, blog articles, and a bit more about who I am. I built it as a space to demonstrate my skills and share my knowledge.

### üéâ Features

- **Portfolio**: A brief introduction to who I am and what I do.
- **Blog**: An aptempt to share my knowledge and experiences with the community.

## üõ† Stack

Built with love and:

- **Monorepo Framework**: Leveraging [Nx](https://nx.dev/) for a streamlined workspace managed with pnpm.
- **Portfolio Frontend**: Crafted using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), beautified with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and structured with TypeScript for robust development.
- **Blog Inspiration**: Drawing from [tailwind nextjs starter blog v2](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) for a solid foundation.
- **Deployment**: Seamlessly deployed on AWS with [SST](https://sst.dev/) for scalability and performance.

## üìÇ Folder Structure

The project is organized in the following scopes:

- **`portfolio`**: Contains all the main logic and components for the portfolio website.
- **`blog`**: Contains all the main logic and components for the blog. TODO: extract business logic into separate lib.
- **`deployer`**: Contains the deployment logic and configurations.
- **`shared`**: Contains shared components and utilities between all scopes.

Each scope follows the same hierarchical structure:

- **`features`**: Contains all the main features of the scope. It handles data fetching, business logic, and state management. The library of this type are allowed to import every other library in the allowed scopes
- **`ui`**: Contains all the presentational components of the scope. It handles the UI and the user interactions. The library of this type are allowed to import every other libraries in the allowed scopes except the `features` one.
- **`utils`**: Contains all the utilities and helpers of the scope. The library of this type are allowed to import only `utils` and `types` libraries inside the visible scopes.
- **`types`**: Contains all the types and interfaces of the scope. The library of this type are allowed to import only `types` libraries inside the visible scopes.
