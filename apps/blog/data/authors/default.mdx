Hey there! I'm Enea, a self-taught web and mobile developer with a knack for turning curiosity into digital solutions.
I dive deep into cybersecurity, groove to techno music, and thrive on tech challenges.

Currently having a blast as a fullstack dev at ApuliaSoft and Switch.
When off the clock, I'm hunting down the latest DX trends to make the life of developers easier.

Got a project or idea? Let's connect and create something amazing!
